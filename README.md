## A mini-java project to practice java collection framework

## First Project(Shopping Mart â€“ Java Console App)

- Welcome to Femi Shop â€“ a simple Java console-based shopping mart where users can view products, add items to their cart, and checkout.
- This project was created as a practice project to explore the Java Collection Framework, especially using Map and List.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… View all available products and prices

- ðŸ›’ Add products to your cart

- ðŸ§º View your current cart and total cost

- ðŸ’³ Checkout and see the final total

- ðŸšª Exit the application

## ðŸ§  What I learnt

- This project helps reinforce the following Java concepts:

- Map (LinkedHashMap) â€“ for storing product names and their prices

- List (ArrayList) â€“ for storing cart items

- Scanner â€“ for handling user input from the console

- Control flow and switch-case â€“ for menu handling

- Method extraction â€“ organizing code in readable methods

- Use of static methods and variables for simple structure
